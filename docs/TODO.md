# Short coding projects

1. Python interface for tensor and operators similar to numpy.
   1. improve interface, improve python tests.
1. Separate memory allocation from tensor class with a new tensorCache class with reference counting 
   1. reduces mem foot-print of python interface
   1. improves mem foot-print of graph
1. Convert make-based build to Cmake based build

# Training and documentation projects
1. Getting started guide
1. How to contribute guide
