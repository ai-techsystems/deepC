# dnn Compiler
---

## 📛 Introduction 

dnn Compiler is designed to **enable and perform** deep learning neural networks by focussing on features of custom ai-accelerators like FPGAs, eFPGAs and other embedded devices like risc-V, raspberry-pi and others.

dnn Compiler is ahead of time compiler producing optimized executable based on [LLVM compiler tool chain](https://llvm.org/) and [openAcc](https://www.openacc.org/) specialized for deep neural networks with [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) as front end.

## 📝 Design

Main component of **dnn Compiler** has been designed to represent and optimize the common deep learning networks in high level graph IR and to transform the computation graph to minimize memory utilization, optimize data layout and fuse computation patterns for different hardware backends.
